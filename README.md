# Solarized Sunset Theme

Two flat themes based on the Solarized color scheme. The dark variant is called *Solarized Sunset* ðŸŒ‡, the light variant *Solarized Sunrise* ðŸŒ….

If you're looking for a matching font, I've created combined variants of Fira Code and Source Code Pro with *cursive italics*, named Victor Frankenstein. The font is freely available at <https://github.com/jansim/victor-frankenstein>.
